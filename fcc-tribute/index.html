        <h3>Bugs has been a tremendously influential character to the young and old alike. First appearing in 1939, Bugs brought laughter to several generations over a span of 78 years. He starred in countless cartoons, commercials, and silver screen movies.
          You can find this rabbit on mugs, lunchboxes, t-shirts, sweaters, and he may even be lurking on the boxers of that guy at work. He is an iconic character who shall never be forgotten.</h3>

        <blockquote>"Some people call me cocky and brash, but actually I am just self-assured. I'm nonchalant, im­perturbable, contemplative. I play it cool, but I can get hot under the collar. And above all I'm a very 'aware' character. I'm well aware that I am
          appearing in an animated car­toon....And sometimes I chomp on my carrot for the same reason that a stand-up comic chomps on his cigar. It saves me from rushing from the last joke to the next one too fast. And I sometimes don't act, I react.
          And I always treat the contest with my pursuers as 'fun and games.' When momentarily I appear to be cornered or in dire danger and I scream, don't be consoined – it's actually a big put-on. Let's face it, Doc. I've read the script and I al­ready
          know how it turns out."</blockquote>
